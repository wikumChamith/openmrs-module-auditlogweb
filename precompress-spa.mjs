// Pre-compress an assembled OpenMRS SPA in place, writing the .gz and .br
// siblings its nginx expects. Taken from openmrs-module-chartsearchai, which
// hit and documented the defect this prevents.
//
// The frontend image's nginx answers a request with <file>.br or <file>.gz when
// one exists, chosen from Accept-Encoding by a map in its config (br is tried
// first, so it is the variant a browser actually receives). It ships such
// siblings for its OWN assembly while `openmrs assemble` emits none. Without
// this script the siblings beside the assembled files are therefore the base
// image's, and they answer for content that no longer exists. See
// Dockerfile.frontend for what that cost.
//
// A sibling is kept only where it is actually smaller than its source, so no
// extension allow-list is needed and none can drift out of date.
//
// Brotli runs at quality 9, not the maximum. Measured 2026-08-25 in
// chartsearchai on a 250-file, 12.6 MB spread taken across a real SPA tree of
// 6554 compressible files, with the time column scaled to that whole tree:
//
//   q9   2.55 MB    ~20s        gzip -9, for comparison: 2.82 MB
//   q10  2.31 MB   ~149s
//   q11  2.25 MB   ~418s
//
// Confirmed there on the real thing rather than left as an extrapolation:
// over a 6031-file assembly, both encodings together take 61s at q9, against
// 354s for a q11 build.
//
// So the maximum costs about five extra minutes of every image build — and
// this image is rebuilt nightly and on every push to main — to land 2.6%
// under q10. What these siblings have to be is CURRENT: a stale one is the
// defect Dockerfile.frontend describes, and no compression level protects
// against it. Raise the quality here only with a re-measure, not by assuming
// these numbers still hold.
//
// index.html is skipped deliberately: the image's startup.sh rewrites it at
// container start (envsubst of SPA_PATH, API_URL, SPA_CONFIG_URLS, …), so a
// pre-compressed copy would shadow the substituted file in exactly the way
// this script exists to prevent. Today `openmrs assemble` emits no index.html
// at all — the base image supplies it — and this keeps the invariant if that
// ever changes.
//
// Each sibling is stamped with its source's mtime. Dockerfile.frontend's guard
// reads that to tell a sibling that came from the assembly apart from one left
// behind by the base image, which it cannot do by content because the final
// stage has no brotli decompressor.
//
